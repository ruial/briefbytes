# About

Hello, my name is Rui Almeida. I'm currently working as a software engineer in the cloud infrastructure domain and I have a Master's degree in Informatics Engineering with a specialization in Computer Systems. I'm a big proponent of open source, DevOps culture and following engineering best practices like continuous integration, evolutionary design and clean code.

As a hobby, I occasionally write about some projects or experiments to summarize and share my learnings. My main research interests are distributed systems and text mining (NLP, IR).
