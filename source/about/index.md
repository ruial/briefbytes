# About

Hello, I'm Rui, a software engineer from Portugal working mostly in the Cloud and Data domains. I have a Master's degree in Informatics Engineering with a specialization in Computer Systems. I've worked on a wide variety of projects, which involved the development of web APIs, the creation of batch and streaming data pipelines and the automation of infrastructure and application deployment.

As a hobby, I occasionally write about some projects or experiments to summarize and share my learnings. My main research interests are distributed systems and text mining topics like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR).
