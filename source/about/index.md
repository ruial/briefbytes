# About

My name is Rui Almeida. I'm currently working as a software engineer while also studying for my Master's degree in Informatics Engineering.

As a hobbie, I ocasionally write about some of my projects and other stuff I find interesting. I like to keep up with the latest technologies and to learn new things.
